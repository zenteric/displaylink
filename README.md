# displaylink-debian
DisplayLink driver installer for Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu and Elementary OS.

#### Problem
[DisplayLink](http://www.displaylink.com/) releases its drivers only for Ubuntu 14.04, and latest kernel version they support is 3.19.


#### displaylink-debian

* Allows you to seamlessly install/uninstall DisplayLink drivers on Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu and Elementary OS.


How? Just run the script! (as regular user)

`./displaylink-debian.sh`

#### Technical

##### displaylink-debian.sh

* Downloads and extracts contents of original [DisplayLink Ubuntu driver] (http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/ubuntu.php>)

* _displaylink-debian.sh_ will modify contents of original _displaylink-installer.sh_ and customize it for Debian. After which install/uninstall is performed. 

* Supported platforms are:

  * Debian: Jessie 8.0/Stretch 9.0/Sid (unstable)
  * Ubuntu: >= 14.04 <= 16.04
  * Elementary OS: Freya

  Regardless of which kernel version you're using.
